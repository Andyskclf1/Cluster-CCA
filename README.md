# Clusterwise-CCA

This repository contains the code used to create a clustering algorithm based on canonical correlation analysis, for both two-way (two data matrices) and three-way data (two data matrices for each subject) of two modalities. In the repository you can also find the code used for the simulation study and analysis of the results (table of means, anova tables and interaction plots).
